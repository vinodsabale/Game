# Game
HTML:

Acts as the structure of your game.
Likely includes a 3x3 grid for the game board created using a table, div elements, or similar.
Includes buttons or elements for resetting the game or displaying messages (like "Player X wins!").
CSS:

Adds visual design to your game.
Defines the size of the grid, colors for players (X and O), hover effects, and overall layout.
Adds animations or transitions to make the game more interactive and visually appealing.
JavaScript:

Handles the game's logic and interactivity.
Tracks player turns and ensures valid moves (e.g., prevents overwriting a cell).
Checks for win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) or a tie after every move.
Resets the game state when needed.
Displays messages or updates the interface dynamically as players interact.
